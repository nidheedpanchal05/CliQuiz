# CliQuiz

An online examination platform, which is easy and effective compared the traditional offline examinations.
The system allows educators to add courses, enroll multiple candidates for the tests, conduct tests, and generate automated results. The candidates can enroll themselves in a course via course code, give tests, and view performances and results to date.
